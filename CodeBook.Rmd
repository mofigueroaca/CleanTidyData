The data processed in this assignment comes from this URL
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The variables selected in these work are those corresponding to mean and standard deviations of those generated by the authors. 
A description of how they were generated is in the features_info.txt file located de zip file mention earlier-
The data was divided in two files train.txt and tes.txtt data and for this assgnment both files were merged.
Separate files with subjects and activities for each observation in those data sets wer provided.
The new data set contain both data sets with the subject and activities, also a new variable that indicates from which data set each obsdarvatino come from.

In order to create this new data set the following steps were followed

A subset of the X_test.txt that contain only the columns needed was made.
Then the file containig the subject data was merge with the subset data.
The file with the activity data was transormed so instead of number names were asignned.
These vector was added to the previous data set created
A new character variable name type that secified that the data come from the test, were created and added to the data set.
the same process was performed with the X_train.txt data set and finaly they were merged.

To create the summary the merged dataset was converted to a tbl format to use with the dplyr package. The data was gouped by activities and by subjects.
Means of the variables by activities and subjects were calculated and a new table was created. This new table named TidyDataSet.txt was submited.


New names were assigned to the variables with the intention of making them easier to use.
These are the names of the variables:
